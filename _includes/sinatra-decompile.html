<h1>Sinatra::Decompile</h1>
<p>
<tt>Sinatra::Decompile</tt> is an extension that provides a method,
conveniently called <tt>decompile</tt>, that will generate a String pattern
for a given route.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Classic Application</h3>
<p>
To use the extension in a classic application all you need to do is require
it:
</p>
<pre>
    require &quot;sinatra&quot;
    require &quot;sinatra/decompile&quot;

    # Your classic application code goes here...
</pre>
<p>
This will add the <tt>decompile</tt> method to the application/class scope,
but you can also call it as <tt>Sinatra::Decompile.decompile</tt>.
</p>
<h3>Modular Application</h3>
<p>
To use the extension in a modular application you need to require it, and
then, tell the application you will use it:
</p>
<pre>
    require &quot;sinatra/base&quot;
    require &quot;sinatra/decompile&quot;

    class MyApp &lt; Sinatra::Base
      register Sinatra::Decompile

      # The rest of your modular application code goes here...
    end
</pre>
<p>
This will add the <tt>decompile</tt> method to the application/class scope.
You can choose not to register the extension, but instead of calling
<tt>decompile</tt>, you will need to call
<tt>Sinatra::Decompile.decompile</tt>.
</p>
