Sinatra Website / Documentation
===============================

This repo contains the Sinatra website and documentation sources published
at http://sinatra.github.com/.

Working Locally
---------------

Grab the sources from github:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra.github.com.git
    $ cd sinatra.github.com

Install dependencies:

    $ gem install jekyll
    $ gem instal rdoc -v 2.3.0

Run the test server:

    $ rake server

Changes are immediately available at:

    http://localhost:4000/

Once your changes are complete, commit them and push back to the
repository to publish:

    $ git commit -m 'note that rtomayko is an asshole'
    $ git push

Creating Blog Posts
-------------------

Blog posts are stored under the `_posts` directory. To create a new blog post
and open your `$EDITOR`, use:

    thor blog:new 'Blog Post Title'

This requires Thor:

    $ gem install thor

Prebuilt Files
--------------

You will need thor, rdoc, and mislav's hanna gem to rebuild static files
and the API docs:

    $ gem install thor rdoc
    $ gem install mislav-hanna --source=http://gems.github.com/

The prebuilt file sources are maintained under the sinatra and sinatra-book
projects. To pull in the latest versions and build them:

    rake pull build

The generated files under the "_includes" and "api" directories need to be
committed after building. To regenerate and add those files to your index
for the next commit:

    rake regen
