# Get Involved

Want to show Sinatra some love? Help out by contributing!

## Documentation

The Sinatra docs are split up in three places:

* [The API docs](http://sinatra.github.com/api/index.html "API Docs")
are generated from Sinatra itself
* [The book](http://sinatra.github.com/book.html) contains in-depth
  information about Sinatra
* And finally, the website itself.

## Find a bug?

Log it in lighthouse by [adding a new
ticket](http://sinatra.lighthouseapp.com/projects/9779-sinatra/tickets/new).
Include as much information as possible about the version of Sinatra,
Ruby, etc. you are using. A gist or pastie of the code that caused the
issue as well as any error messages are also very helpful.

## Have a patch?

Bugs and feature requests that include patches are much more likely to
get attention. Here are some guidelines that will help ensure your patch
can be applied as quickly as possible:

1. **Use [Git](http://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com).**
   The easiest way to get setup is to fork the
   [github.com/sinatra/sinatra repo](http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/).
2. **Write tests.** If you add or modify functionality, it must include
   specs. If you don't write specs, we have to and this can hold up
   acceptance of the patch.
3. **Mind the `README`.** If the patch adds or modifies a major feature,
   modify the `README.rdoc` file to reflect that. Again, if you don't
   update the `README`, we have to and this holds up acceptance.
4. Once you're ready, push your changes to a topic branch and add a note
   to the ticket with the URL. Or, say something like, "you can find the
   patch on johndoe/foobranch".

All that being said, _we will take what we can get._ If you prefer to
attach diffs in emails to the mailing list, that's fine -- but do know
that _someone_ will need to take the diff through the process described
above and this can hold things up quite a bit.

## Want to help out?

If you'd like to help out but aren't sure how, take a look at the [High
Priority / Needs
Owner](http://sinatra.lighthouseapp.com/projects/9779-sinatra/tickets/bins/13046)
ticket bin. This is a list of issues planned for the next release that
do not currently have as assignee. If you find something that looks
interesting, leave a note -- a simple "Taking..." is fine) in the
ticket. Once you've worked a few issues, someone will add you as an
assignee.

Or help other uses on the Mailing List or on IRC:

### Mailing List

The Sinatra mailing list has over 250 subscribers, many of which are
happy to help out newbies or talk about potential feature additions:

[http://groups.google.com/group/sinatrarb](http://groups.google.com/group/sinatrarb)

If you have a problem or question, please make sure to include all the
relevant information in your mail, like the Sinatra version you're
using, what version of Ruby you have, and so on. A gist or pastie of the
code that causes the issue is also very helpful.

### IRC

You can find us on the Freenode network in
[#sinatra](irc://chat.freenode.net/#sinatra).

There's usually someone online at any given time, but we cannot pay
attention to the channel all the time, so please stick around for a
while after asking a question.
