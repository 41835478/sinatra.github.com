# Get Involved

Want to show Sinatra some love? Help out by contributing!

You can:

* Add or update the documentation
* Help out with bugfixes or new features
* Hang out in [#sinatra](irc://irc.freenode.net/sinatra) and help others
* Or just give us some feedback on what we did and didn't do right

## Documentation

The Sinatra docs are split up in three places:

* The API docs are generated from Sinatra itself
* [The book](http://github.com/sinatra/book) contains in-depth information about Sinatra
* And finally, the website (you're looking at it)



## How can I clone the Sinatra repository?

First of all, you'll need the [Git][git] version control system. [Git][git] is
available for all major platforms:
* [Windows][git_win]
* [Mac OS X][git_osx]
* Linux and BSD users can usually acquire [Git][git] through their Package
  Management System, e.g. `apt-get install git-core` on Debian systems.

After that, cloning the Sinatra repository is as easy as typing the following
into your command line:

    git clone git://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra.git

[git]: http://git-scm.com
[git_win]: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
[git_osx]: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/
