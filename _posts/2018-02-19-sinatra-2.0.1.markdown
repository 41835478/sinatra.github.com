I have just released Sinatra v2.0.1 and Mustermann v1.0.2.

Before we begin, I want to thank everyone who contributed, helped test pre-releases, and continues to use and support the project.

## Security Fix CVE-2018-7212

The rack-protection-v2.0.1 contains a security fix for [CVE-2018-7212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7212).

It was determined a path traversal attack using backslashes was possible on Windows environment. We highly recommend you upgrade at least `rack-protection` if you're on Windows, or apply [this patch](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/pull/1379) provided by [Orange Tsai from DEVCORE](https://github.com/orangetw).

If you're on older version of Sinatra, we have backported this patch to `rack-protection` in [v1.5.4](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-protection/versions/1.5.4).

## Releases

Sinatra v2.0.1 includes the release of the following gems, and associated versions:

* `sinatra`: v2.0.1
* `sinatra-contrib`: v2.0.1
* `rack-protection`: v2.0.1
* `mustermann`: v1.0.2
